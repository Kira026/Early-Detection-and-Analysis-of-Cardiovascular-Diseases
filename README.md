# Early-Detection-and-Analysis-of-Cardiovascular-Diseases
cardiovasculardisease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and should be effective early and timely intervention and prevention mechanisms should be investigated. The project, called “Predictive Hearts,” aims to develop machine learning for early detection and diagnosis of heart disease. This model uses relevant medical information such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and behavior using the Python programming language and many data analysis structures. The process includes preliminary data, electronic data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and design. In addition, the performance of the model is evaluated using indicators such as accuracy, precision and memorability. Through visualization and analysis, you can understand risks and gain the ability to predict the model, helping doctors make decisions. The primary goal of the program is to provide reliable and measurable tools for the early detection of people at risk of heart disease, facilitate self-treatment, and improve patient outcomes.
Heart disease is a major concern in today's society. It is difficult to manually determine the difference between heart disease based on risk. However, using machine learning, we can instantly predict whether a person has heart disease. Thanks to the rapid and accurate classification of heart diseases, doctors will offer appropriate treatment to patients and save their lives.
